Federal student loans have fixed interest rates that are set by Congress each year and vary by loan type.3 Borrowers can easily find out the exact interest rate they'll pay on these loans, in addition to any funding fees that apply. They can also choose their repayment plan upfront to lock in a monthly payment they can afford. 

Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans for federal student loans can even help borrowers get a monthly payment as low as $0 based on their income, and they lead to forgiveness of remaining loan balances after 20 to 25 years depending on the chosen plan
