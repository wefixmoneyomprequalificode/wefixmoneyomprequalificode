Predatory lending refers to a range of lending practices that can harm consumers’ finances. For example, predatory loans may obscure the true loan obligation, or they might come with a slew of hidden fees and fine print. These loans typically aren’t based on the borrower's ability to repay, and they often have no consumer protections that apply to other types of borrowing. Student loans aren’t predatory, but they can still potentially lead to financial problems if they’re not managed correctly.
